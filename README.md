Text in Hello and get a response in one of the many languages spoken in Anchorage

Anchorage has 3 of the top 5 most [diverse census tracts](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/12/us/most-diverse-place-in-america/index.html) in the US. There is a diversity celebration on Sunday 6/28/2015. 
The app would use Twilio and you would text "Hello" and randomly recieve Hello in another language back to you and the name of the language and how many people speak that language in Anchorage and possibly a fun fact. 
I would like to populate it from a Google Spreadsheet or Socrata OpendData API.
